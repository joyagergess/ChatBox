This project is a  chat application where two users can log in, send and receive messages, and track the read/delivered status. If a user misses multiple messages, the app provides an AI-generated "catch-up" summary using OpenAI. The database is designed as a general messaging system to support many users and conversations in the future, even though the UI currently focuses on a single chat between two users. The tech stack includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6), PHP, and MySQL.
